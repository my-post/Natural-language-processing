Problem Statement
Firstly, the Book needs to be preprocessed by using simple preprocessing tools of nltk package
so as to achieve correct inferences in pos tagging and frequency distribution of tokens against
word length needs to be analyzed. Also, we need to analyze the word clouds of books after pre
processing with and without stopwords.

After doing the required preprocessing. The 2​ nd​ Round of the project is to find the Nouns and
Verbs from novels and to categorize them into 25 categories and 16 categories for Nouns and
Verbs respectively. After that we need to analyse the frequency of each category for each noun
and verb in their corresponding hierarchies and plot a histogram for the same for each novel.
After that the task is to recognise all the entities and their types i.e. to categorize all the
entities into Persons, Location, Organisation, Geo-Political Entity, Facility and Vehicles. Now,
By using the performance measures we need to evaluate the model. At last we need to Extract
the relationship between the entities (mainly the characters involved in the novel).
